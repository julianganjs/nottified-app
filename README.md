# Nott-ified
This repository contains the source code for the Nott-ified app. Nott-ified is an Android app that acts as a central platform to access various IoT solutions which were developed for a larger project involving smart campuses. The name is derived from a hybrid of the word “notified” and the author's university name, “Nottingham”.

The objective of the main project is to develop multiple IoT solutions for a smart campus which will improve the efficiency and operations of campus services while enhancing community safety and security. Some areas that are targeted in the project are managing parking spaces, streamlining security clearance procedures at campus entrances, tracking the operating status of campus facilities and offices, and improving operations in the campus cafeteria.

The purpose of Nott-ified is to enable users to submit requests and access helpful information, such as viewing the status of campus facilities, placing and tracking food orders in the cafeteria, and checking the availability of parking spaces and study spaces on campus.

The app was developed using Android Studio, and utilizes XML for each app screen's design along with Java for the functionalities. The app also leverages the XAMPP platform, which provides an easy-to-use control panel for managing Apache, MySQL, and other services. With this, PHP can be used for server-side scripting and MySQL for database management. Data is transferred between the app and database through HTTP requests via various PHP pages.

## Prerequisites
- Android Studio
> Android Studio is required to upload the app to an emulator or to your own Android device.
- XAMPP
> XAMPP is needed to host the MySQL database and PHP pages for the app to work properly.
